# Auto Dock

## Overview
Auto Dock is a Python-based project designed for automated documentation generation of codebases. It comprehensively scans a specified directory for source code files, generates a structured documentation prompt for each file, and utilizes a language model to produce detailed markdown documentation. The output is tailored based on the specified language, ensuring accessibility for diverse audiences.

## Features
- **Multi-language Support:** Auto Dock supports multiple languages, allowing users to generate documentation in English, Russian, Ukrainian, Chinese, Spanish, and Polish.
- **File Filtering:** Users can specify files to be ignored during the documentation generation process.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** The tool can handle multiple files and generate documentation in a time-efficient manner, utilizing threading for time management.
- **Prompt Customization:** The generation of prompts is dynamic and customized according to the language and project name, ensuring clarity and relevance.
- **Progress Tracking:** Provides visual feedback on the documentation generation process with progress bars.

## Structure
The project consists of several key components:
- **config.py:** Defines language mappings and generates language-specific prompts.
- **main.py:** Implements the core functionality for file scanning, code reading, prompt generation, and interaction with the language model.
- **utilities.py:** Contains helper functions for styling text in the console and managing progress.
- **providers_test.py:** Allows for testing different providers for the language model, ensuring functionality and responsiveness.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists necessary dependencies for the project.

## Usage
To use Auto Dock, you must first set up your environment and install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`. The primary entry point for the application is `main.py`, which accepts command-line arguments for project name, root directory, ignored files, and language preferences.

Hereâ€™s a basic command structure:

```bash
python main.py --name_project=YourProjectName --root_dir=YourProjectDirectory --ignore='["ignored_file.py"]' --languages='["en"]'
```

After executing the command, Auto Dock will scan the specified directory, generate documentation for each included file based on the stored prompts, and save the output to a markdown file (defaulted to README.md) in the specified language.# ./config.py

## Overview
The `config.py` file defines a dictionary for language types and a class `GenerateLanguagePrompt` that generates prompts based on the specified languages. It is designed to facilitate the creation of consistent documentation in multiple languages using a specific format.

## Features
- A dictionary `language_type` that maps language codes to their respective indices.
- The `GenerateLanguagePrompt` class that:
  - Initializes with a dictionary of languages.
  - Generates prompts for each language available in the `language_type` dictionary.
  - Provides a method to create a base prompt for documentation purposes.

## Structure
- **Dictionary**:
  - `language_type`: Contains language codes as keys (e.g., "en", "ru") and their respective integer values.

- **Class**:
  - `GenerateLanguagePrompt`: 
    - **Methods**:
      - `__init__(self, languages: dict[str, int])`: Initializes the class with the provided dictionary of languages.
      - `generate(self) -> dict`: Generates and returns a dictionary of language prompts.
      - `gen_prompt(self, language: str) -> list[str]`: Creates a list of base prompts formatted for the specified language.

## Usage
To use the functionality provided in `config.py`, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Prompt Generator**:
   - Create an instance of `GenerateLanguagePrompt` by passing the `language_type` dictionary.

   ```python
   GLP = GenerateLanguagePrompt(language_type)
   ```

2. **Generate Prompts**:
   - Call the `generate()` method of the instance to retrieve a dictionary of prompts for each language.

   ```python
   language_prompt = GLP.generate()
   ```

3. **Get List of Languages**:
   - You can also access the list of available languages through the `keys()` method of the `language_type` dictionary to see which languages are supported.

   ```python
   print(list(language_type.keys()))
   ```

### Method Descriptions
- `__init__(self, languages: dict[str, int])`: 
  - Initializes a new instance of `GenerateLanguagePrompt` with the provided dictionary of languages. Creates a list of language keys stored in `self.languages`.

- `generate(self) -> dict`:
  - Iterates over the list of languages and calls `gen_prompt()` for each language to generate a dictionary containing a language index as the key and the corresponding prompt as the value.

- `gen_prompt(self, language: str) -> list[str]`:
  - Takes a language code string and returns a list containing prompts specifically formatted for documentation in that language. Each prompt adheres to a specific structure that encourages consistency and clarity in documentation.# Overview

`main.py` is a Python script designed to automate the process of generating documentation for a software project.

The `requirements.txt` file specifies the dependencies needed for a Python project to function correctly. This file is essential for managing package installations and ensuring that the project runs with the appropriate versions of the libraries.

# Features

- Lists all required libraries and their specific versions.
- Facilitates easy installation of dependencies using package management tools like `pip`.
- Enhances project portability, allowing other developers to replicate the development environment effortlessly.

# Structure

The `requirements.txt` file contains a simple list of packages, each on a new line, alongside their version specifications. For example:

```
colorama==0.4.6
