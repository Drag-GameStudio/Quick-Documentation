Main idea:  
This code defines a Python project "quick-doc-py" that automates generating documentation for a codebase by scanning source files, creating prompts describing their content, querying GPT-based AI models to produce explanations, and compiling those into readable documents. It supports ignoring certain files or folders, customizing the language, and testing various AI providers.

Easy example of usage in English:  
Suppose you have a Python project in folder `/my_project` and want to create documentation describing what each Python file does with example usage. You run this tool like this in the command line:

```
python quick_doc_py/manage.py --root_dir /my_project --ignore "*__init__.py,*__pycache__" --lang en
```

The tool will:  
- Recursively read all files in `/my_project` except those ignored (like `__init__.py`)  
- Generate prompts to ask GPT to explain each file's main idea and usage example  
- Collect GPT's answers and compile a full documentation markdown file at `/my_project/documentation.md`  

This helps you quickly get meaningful, human-readable docs for your code without writing them manually.

The `.gitignore` file specifies untracked files that Git should ignore in the repository. In this case, it contains a single entry:

```
/__pycache__
```

This means Git will ignore the `__pycache__` directory at the root of the repository.

### Explanation:
- `__pycache__` directories are automatically generated by Python to store bytecode-compiled versions of modules for faster imports.
- Ignoring this folder helps keep the repository clean by excluding these generated files that do not need to be version-controlled.

### Usage:
Just include this `.gitignore` file in your repository root. Git will then skip tracking any files or folders inside the `__pycache__` directory, avoiding clutter and unnecessary commits of cache files.

If you want, I can also help clarify specific functions or how to use this code for your project!

Sure! Here's the documentation in English for the file `quick_doc_py\providers_test.py` based on the provided code:

---

# quick_doc_py\providers_test.py

## Overview
This module tests the availability and responsiveness of different AI model providers supported by the `g4f` library. It includes utilities for running tests with timeouts, displaying progress bars, and formatting console text with colors. The main functionality revolves around detecting which providers successfully respond to a test prompt.

## Key Components

### `timeout_control(timeout)`
A decorator factory for running a function with a specified timeout. It runs the decorated function in a separate thread and returns `None` if the function does not finish within `timeout` seconds.

### `TextStyle` class
Initializes colorama for console text color support and provides a method `get_text` to colorize and style strings for colored terminal output.

### `ProgressBar` class
Displays a progress bar in the console. The progress bar shows the percentage completed and a colored visual bar updated as testing progresses.

### `ProviderTest` class
Main class that manages provider testing.

- `__init__(self, model_name: str)`: Initializes the tester with a specific model name (e.g., 'gpt-4').
- `get_providers(self)`: Retrieves a list of available providers from `g4f.Provider` dynamically and initializes a progress bar.
- `test_provider(self, provider_name: str) -> tuple[bool, str]`: Tests a single provider by invoking `test_provider_timeout` with a 30-second timeout. Returns a tuple indicating if it is working and the received response or None.
- `test_provider_timeout(self, provider)`: Decorated with `timeout_control` to enforce a 30-second timeout on testing the provider. It sends a simple "Hello" chat message to determine if the provider responds.
- `test_providers(self)`: Iterates over all providers, running tests with progress feedback. Collects and returns a dictionary of providers that responded successfully.

### `provider_test(model_name: str) -> dict`
Helper function to create a `ProviderTest` instance, retrieve providers, and run tests returning a dictionary of working providers.

### `main()`
CLI entry point:
- Parses `--name_model` command line argument specifying the model to test.
- Runs provider tests and prints results.

## Usage Example
Run as a script from the command line:
```bash
python providers_test.py --name_model gpt-4
```
This command tests all providers for the `gpt-4` model and displays providers that respond correctly.

# GPT Module Documentation

This module provides a class `GPT` that serves as a client interface for interacting with various GPT-based language models via different providers. It simplifies making chat completions requests and managing retries in case of errors.

## Class: GPT

### Initialization
```python
GPT(provider=PollinationsAI, gpt_model="gpt-4o")
```
- `provider`: The provider from the `g4f.Provider` module to use for API requests. Defaults to `PollinationsAI`.
- `gpt_model`: The name of the GPT model to use. Defaults to `"gpt-4o"`.

### Methods

#### `get_answer(prompt)`
Sends a prompt to the model and retrieves the generated answer.

- **Parameters**:  
  `prompt` (list of dict): A list of messages structured as dictionaries with `"role"` and `"content"` keys, representing the conversation history.

- **Returns**:  
  A string containing the model's reply.

- **Behavior**:  
  Attempts to get a completion response from the client. If an exception occurs (e.g., network issues), waits 5 seconds and retries recursively.

#### `get_answer_without_history(prompt)`
Sends a single user prompt to the model without providing prior conversation history.

- **Parameters**:  
  `prompt` (str): A string representing the user's message.

- **Returns**:  
  A string containing the model's reply or `None` if the request fails.

### Usage example:
```python
from quick_doc_py.gpt.gpt import GPT
client = GPT()
response = client.get_answer([{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}])
print(response)
```

---

This module abstracts provider and model details and handles basic retry logic for making chat completion requests with GPT models.

Here's the documentation for the file `quick_doc_py\gpt\prompt_handler.py` in English:

---

# Documentation for `prompt_handler.py`

This module contains the `PromptGenerator` class, which is responsible for generating different types of prompts used to request documentation for code files. It allows you to create prompts tailored to either individual files or an overall summary for a set of code snippets.

## Class: PromptGenerator

### Purpose
`PromptGenerator` takes in raw code data and prepares prompts in a specified language to instruct a language model to generate documentation or code explanations.

### Constructor
```python
PromptGenerator(prompt_data, language="en")
```
- **prompt_data** (`dict` or similar): A collection of code content keyed by file paths or identifiers.
- **language** (`str`, default `"en"`): The language in which the documentation should be written.

### Methods

#### `get_prompts_for_files()`
Generates a list of prompts, one per code file, asking for documentation in the specified language.

- Iterates through each file in `prompt_data`.
- For each file, creates a prompt string asking to write documentation for that file's code.
  
**Returns:**  
`list[str]` - A list of prompt strings, one for each file.

#### `get_main_prompt()`
Creates a single prompt that asks for the main idea and a simple usage example for the entire collection of code passed in through `prompt_data`.

**Returns:**  
`str` - A prompt string requesting an overview and example usage in the specified language.

---

If you'd like, I can also help explain how to use this in a project or generate example prompts and expected model outputs.

Here's documentation for the code in `quick_doc_py\reader\read_folder.py`:

---

# Module `read_folder`

This module provides functionality to read files recursively from a directory, optionally ignoring specified files or folders. It collects the contents of the files into a dictionary keyed by file paths relative to the root directory.

## Classes

### `FilesReader`

Handles the reading and storage of file contents.

- **Attributes**
  - `files` (dict): A dictionary storing the content of files. Keys are file names (relative paths), values are file contents.

- **Methods**

  - `read_file(file_path: str) -> str | None`

    Reads the content of a single file located at `file_path`.

    Returns the file content as a string if successful, or `None` if reading fails.

  - `add_file(file_path: str, file_name: str) -> None`

    Reads a file and adds its content to the `files` dictionary under the key `file_name` (typically the relative path).

    Does nothing if the file cannot be read.

  - `get_all_prompt() -> dict`

    Returns the current `files` dictionary containing all read files.

---

### `Reader`

Manages recursively reading files from a root directory, respecting ignore rules for files and folders.

- **Constructor**

  - `__init__(path: str, ignore_files: list[str] = [])`

    - `path`: Root directory path to start reading files from.
    - `ignore_files`: List of filenames or folder patterns to ignore. Wildcards are supported when the ignore string starts with `*`, matching exact file or folder names.

- **Methods**

  - `read_folder() -> FilesReader`

    Walks the directory tree starting from `self.path`.

    Skips directories and files based on the ignore rules.

    Adds non-ignored files to a `FilesReader` instance and returns it.

  - `get_local_path(file_path: str) -> str`

    Computes the path of `file_path` relative to the root `self.path`, ending with a backslash `\`.

  - `check_ignore_files(local_file_path: str, file_name: str) -> bool`

    Checks if a file should be included by comparing against ignore patterns.

    Supports ignoring exact matches or filenames with a leading wildcard (`*`).

    Returns `True` if the file should **not** be ignored (i.e., included), `False` otherwise.

  - `check_ignore_folders(local_folder_path: str) -> bool`

    Checks if the folder path (relative to root) should be ignored based on ignore patterns.

    Handles wildcards for folder names and full folder paths.

    Returns `True` if the folder should **not** be ignored, `False` otherwise.

---

## Usage Example

```python
from quick_doc_py.reader.read_folder import Reader

reader = Reader(
    path=r"C:\MyProject",
    ignore_files=["*__init__.py", "*__pycache__"]
)

files_reader = reader.read_folder()
all_files_content = files_reader.get_all_prompt()

# all_files_content is a dict mapping relative file paths to file contents
```

---

This module is designed to help with collecting all source files (except ignored ones) and reading their contents into a structure useful for further processing, such as generating documentation or analysis.
