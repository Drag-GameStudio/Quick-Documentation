## Getting Started

To begin using Auto Dock, you must first install necessary dependencies as listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Here's a simple guide to get started:

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Import necessary modules as required in your scripts.

3. Create an instance of `AutoDock` by providing the required parameters:
   - `root_dir`: The directory of the project you want documented.
   - `language`: Language preference for generated documentation.
   - `ignore_file`: List of files or patterns to ignore.
   - `project_name`: Your project’s name.

4. Use the `get_response` method to create the documentation and then save it using the `save_dock` method.

## Operating Principle

Auto Dock operates by doing the following:
1. **File Discovery**: It recursively scans the root directory for code files while checking for ignored files.
2. **Code Extraction**: The contents of all found files are extracted and prepared for processing.
3. **Prompt Generation**: A structured prompt is generated containing all code snippets.
4. **GPT Interaction**: The prompt is sent to an AI language model using the `GptHandler`, and the generated response is processed.
5. **Documentation Saving**: The response obtained is formatted and saved into a specified documentation file (e.g., `README.md`).

## Classes and Methods

### ReqHendler
This class handles the retrieval and processing of code files from the project directory.

- **Methods**:
  - `__init__(root_dir: str, language: str = "en", ignore_file: list[str] = None, project_name: str = "Python Project")`: Initializes a `ReqHendler` object.
  - `get_files_from_directory(current_path: str = "")`: Recursively retrieves all files from the specified directory.
  - `is_ignored(path: str)`: Checks if the given path should be ignored.
  - `get_code_from_file()`: Reads code from all retrieved files.

### GptHandler
This class interfaces with the AI model to obtain responses based on provided prompts.

- **Methods**:
  - `__init__(provider: str = "DarkAI")`: Initializes a `GptHandler` object with a specified provider.
  - `get_answer(prompt: str)`: Sends a prompt to the AI model and retrieves the response.

### AnswerHandler
This class manages the AI responses and saves the generated documentation.

- **Methods**:
  - `__init__(answer: str, prompt: str)`: Initializes an `AnswerHandler` object with the provided answer and prompt.
  - `save_documentation(name: str = "README.md")`: Saves the formatted answer to a documentation file.
  - `combine_response(new_response: str)`: Appends a new response to the existing answers.
  - `make_req_form(prompt: str)`: Prepares a request form for the AI model.

### AutoDock
The main class that orchestrates the documentation generation process.

- **Methods**:
  - `__init__(root_dir: str, language: str = "en", ignore_file: list[str] = None, project_name: str = "Python Project")`: Initializes an `AutoDock` object.
  - `get_response(parts: int)`: Retrieves responses from the AI model for the specified number of parts.
  - `get_part_of_response(prompt: str, answer_handler: AnswerHandler = None)`: Executes a request to get a part of the response from the AI model.
  - `save_dock(answer_handler: AnswerHandler, name: str = "README.md")`: Saves the generated documentation.

### Utilities
This module provides additional functionalities like text styling and progress indication.

- **Classes**:
  - `TextStyle`: Formats text with specified color and background.
  - `ProgressBar`: Displays a progress bar in the console.
  
- **Functions**:
  - `time_manager(func)`: A decorator that monitors and logs the execution time of function calls.

## Examples of Use

Here’s a simple example of how you can use Auto Dock in your project:

```python
from auto_dock import AutoDock

# Initialize AutoDock
auto_dock = AutoDock(root_dir='path/to/your/project', 
                     language='en', 
                     ignore_file=['.git/', '__pycache__'], 
                     project_name='My Project')

# Fetch and process the response
answer_handler = auto_dock.get_response(parts=2)  # Specify number of parts you want
auto_dock.save_dock(answer_handler=answer_handler)
```
